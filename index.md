With over a decade of professional experience all levels (**operational**, **tactical** and **strategic**), I can help out with:

* building **Proof-of-Concepts** from scratch for your business idea

* figuring out solutions to tricky **automation problems**

* helping you transition to a micro-service infrastructure on **Amazon Web Services**

* offering an extra hand to help you reach your **delivery goals**

* dealing with some **legacy** Ruby-on-Rails codebase

* providing business and **strategic analysis** with a technical perspective
